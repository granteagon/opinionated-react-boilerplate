Module-ize this project as much as possible allowing developers who started from the boilerplate an upgrade path that doesn't require they restructure existing code.

### 0.0.3
Allow creation of as many instances of frontend, backend and native builds as needed under a single umbrella project.
- Separate build environments for dev and production for each instance.
- Ability to run/build/test environments individually or altogether.
